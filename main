      <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious virus which was first spotted in Wuhan, China in December 2019. This tragedy caused a global pandemic with a total number of 134 million cases and 2.9 million deaths (April 2020). The most common symptoms are fever, a newly contagious cough and a loss of taste and smell with other rare symptoms e.g. muscle pain, sore throat and breathing difficulties. COVID-19 is caused when respiratory droplets from an infected person get into the mouth, nose or eyes of people in close contact with this person. The closer and longer the interactions with an infected person, the more likely they are able to spread the disease to the other person.</p>

      <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <h7>Here is the events that took place in the UK after the virus grew more serious: </h7>
      <p>
<li>
The UK went into lockdown in the last week of March 2020. Covid was recognised significant in mid-February but flights in and out of the countries resumed hence increasing the inflow of foreigners and hence influx of the virus. The UK government imposed a non-essential travel and contact lockdown with the closure of schools, colleges and gathering places. Unnecessary travel was not encouraged and meeting in public areas was restricted to a certain amount of people.</li>
	<li>As April ended, the active number of covid cases had decreased to an all-time low and hence lockdown was lifted gradually. This prominently was the end of the first wave of Covid. Local restrictions got lifted and by the time of September, there was a sharp increase in covid cases and hence the government introduced new tiered restrictions that were implemented in December. </li>
	<li>By the time these initiatives got implemented, a new variant of the Covid virus was discovered and a national emergency was called. As a result, a lot of European countries banned travel from the UK to reduce the flow of this Covid variant originated in England, and UK again went into lockdown with tier restrictions. The government eased the lockdown in time for Christmas but immediately after, the UK went into another lockdown with the closure of schools. </li>
    <li>In January 2021, the UK had started vaccinating people aged 50 and above. Pfizer-BioNTech Covid - 19 Vaccine had started and the vaccination rates in the UK kept rising. By the end of January, new quarantine rules were imposed on incoming travellers and once the government was able to get a hold of the number of active cases, business activities and schools re opened in March.</li>
    <li>Currently, the UK is in a period off reopening its hospitality, entertainment, and leisure. As the vaccine is being given to more people daily, the Prime Minster has developed a roadmap which indicates what and when will open. June 21st is the expected date where all restrictions are to be lifted in the UK!</li>
